      <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</b></Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>At Pop, your privacy is a top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and focus on building meaningful connections.</Typography>

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.</Typography>

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><b>We do not compromise with your privacy.</b> We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.</Typography>

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><b>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data.</b> Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!</Typography>

      <Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><b>We work hard to keep your information secure.</b> We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.</Typography>

This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>This Privacy Policy applies beginning Aug 25, 2019.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1">Pop Social, Inc.</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1">301 Congress Ave Suite 2200</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1">Austin, TX 78701</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>United States</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Pop. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our "services" in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we've added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy – not this Privacy Policy – applies.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>It goes without saying, we can't help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you'd like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Information you give us</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</Typography>
<ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your major, home town, graduation year and interest.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered "special" or "sensitive" in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</li></Typography>
</ul>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Information we receive from others</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</Typography>

<ul><Typography variant="subtitle1"><b><li>Other Users</li></b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you including feedback.</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><b><li>Social Media</li></b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Pop account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><b><li>Other Partners</li></b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Pop ads are published on a partner's websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign's success).</Typography>
</ul>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>Information collected when you use our services</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you've used, how you've used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:</Typography>

<ul><Typography variant="subtitle1"><b><li>Usage Information</li></b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you've been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><b><li>Device information</li></b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</Typography>
<ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device' settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address);</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength;</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom><li>information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.</li></Typography>
</ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><b><li>Other information with your consent</li></b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren't using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).</Typography>
</ul>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>4. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). We use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a "Do Not Track" (" DNT") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including POP, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.

</ul>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>6. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users' information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users' information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>With other users</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you're comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>With our service providers and partners</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>For corporate transactions</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>When required by law</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>To enforce legal rights</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>With your consent or at your request</Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may also share this information with third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>7. YOUR RIGHTS</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</Typography>
<ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>Device permissions. Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</li></Typography>
</ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</Typography>
<ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request <a href="mailto:yourbubblepop@gmail.com">yourbubblepop@gmail.com</a></li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us <a href="mailto:yourbubblepop@gmail.com">yourbubblepop@gmail.com</a></li></Typography>
</ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</Typography>

<ul>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</li></Typography>
</ul>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>8. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:yourbubblepop@gmail.com">yourbubblepop@gmail.com</a></Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>9. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account deletion. During this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.</Typography>

<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</Typography>
<ol>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some "traffic data" is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</li></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1"><li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.</li></Typography>
</ol>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>10. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>11. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</b></Typography>
<Typography variant="subtitle1" gutterBottom>Because we're always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</Typography>

<Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom><b>12. HOW TO CONTACT US</b></Typography>
